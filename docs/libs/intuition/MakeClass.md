**NAME**

MakeClass -- Create and initialize a boopsi class. (V36)

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    iclass = MakeClass( ClassID, SuperClassID, SuperClassPtr,
    D0                  A0       A1            A2
            InstanceSize, Flags )
            D0            D1

    struct IClass *MakeClass( UBYTE *, UBYTE *, struct IClass *,
            UWORD, ULONG );

```
**FUNCTION**

For class implementors only.

This function creates a new public or private boopsi class.
The superclass should be defined to be another boopsi class:
all classes are descendants of the class &#034;rootclass&#034;.

Superclasses can be public or private.  You provide a name/ID
for your class if it is to be a public class (but you must
have registered your class name and your attribute ID's with
Commodore before you do this!).  For a public class, you would
also call [AddClass](AddClass.md) to make it available after you have
finished your initialization.

Returns pointer to an IClass data structure for your
class.  You then initialize the [Hook](_012D.md) cl_Dispatcher for
your class methods code.  You can also set up special data
shared by all objects in your class, and point cl_UserData at it.
The last step for public classes is to call [AddClass](AddClass.md).

You dispose of a class created by this function by calling
[FreeClass](FreeClass.md).

**INPUTS**

ClassID = NULL for private classes, the name/ID string for public
classes
SuperClassID = name/ID of your new class's superclass.  NULL if
superclass is a private class
SuperClassPtr = pointer to private superclass.  Only used if
SuperClassID is NULL.  You are required never to provide
a NULL superclass.
InstanceSize = the size of the instance data that your class's
objects will require, beyond that data defined for
your superclass's objects.
Flags = for future enhancement, including possible additional
parameters.  Provide zero for now.

RESULT
Pointer to the resulting class, or NULL if not possible:
- no memory for class data structure
- public superclass not found
- public class of same name/ID as this one already exists

NOTES

EXAMPLE
Creating a private subclass of a public class:

/* per-object instance data defined by my class     */
struct MyInstanceData {
ULONG   mid_SomeData;
};

/* some useful table I'll share use for all objects */
UWORD myTable[] = {
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
};

struct IClass       *
initMyClass()
{
ULONG __saveds  myDispatcher();
ULONG   hookEntry();    /* asm-to-C interface glue       */
struct IClass   *cl;
struct IClass   *MakeClass();

if ( cl =  MakeClass( NULL,
SUPERCLASSID, NULL,  /* superclass is public */
sizeof (struct MyInstanceData),
0 ))
{
/* initialize the cl_Dispatcher [Hook](_012D.md)       */
cl-&#062;cl_Dispatcher.h_Entry = hookEntry;
cl-&#062;cl_Dispatcher.h_SubEntry = myDispatcher;
cl-&#062;cl_Dispatcher.h_Data = (VOID *) 0xFACE; /* unused */

cl-cl_UserData = (ULONG) myTable;
}
return ( cl );
}

BUGS
The typedef 'Class' isn't consistently used.  Class pointers
used blindly should be APTR, or struct IClass for class implementors.
