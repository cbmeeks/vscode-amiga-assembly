**NAME**

SysReqHandler -- Handle system requester input. (V36)

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    num = SysReqHandler( Window, IDCMPFlagsPtr, WaitInput )
    D0                   A0      A1             D0

    LONG SysReqHandler( struct Window *, ULONG *, BOOL );

```

**FUNCTION**

Handles input for a window returned by either [BuildSysRequest](BuildSysRequest.md)
or BuildEasyRequest().  These functions with SysReqHandler()
you can perform an &#034;asynchronous&#034; EasyRequest() or [AutoRequest](AutoRequest.md).
That is to say, you can perform other processing while you
wait for the requester to be satisfied.

Each time this function is called, it will process all
IDCMPMessages that the window has received.  If the parameter
'WaitInput' is non-zero, SysReqHandler() will wait for input
(by calling [WaitPort](../exec/WaitPort.md)) if there are no IDCMP messages.

SysReqHandler() returns the same values as EasyRequest(): A gadget
ID greater than equal to 0, and  -1 if one of the other IDCMP
events were received.

An additional value of -2 is returned if the input processed
does not satisfy the requester.  In this case, you might
perform some processing and call SysReqHandler() again.

Note: this function does NOT terminate the system request.
Not only must you call [FreeSysRequest](FreeSysRequest.md) to eliminate the request,
but you may also continue processing after an event which would
normally terminate a normal call to EasyRequest().

EXAMPLE
Implementation of EasyRequest() input loop:

window = BuildEasyRequest( ZZZZ )
while ( (retval = SysReqHandler( window, idcmp_ptr, TRUE )) == -2 )
{
/* loop     */;
}
FreeSysRequest( window );

EXAMPLE
Request a volume, but don't remove the requester when the
user inserts the wrong disk:

struct [EasyStruct](_00D4.md) volumeES = {
sizeof (struct EasyStruct),
0,
&#034;Volume Request&#034;,
&#034;Please insert volume %s in any drive.&#034;,
&#034;Cancel&#034;
};

Volume *
getVolume( volname )
UBYTE   *volname;
{
struct [Window](_00D4.md)       *window;
Volume              *volume = NULL;
Volume              *findVolume();
int                 retval;

window = BuildEasyRequest( NULL, &#038;volumeES, IDCMP_DISKINSERTED,
volname );

while ( (retval = SysReqHandler( window, NULL, TRUE )) != 0 )
{
/* not cancelled yet    */

/* when IDCMP_DISKINSERTED, check for volume */
if (( retval == -1 ) &#038;&#038; (volume = findVolume( volname )))
break;
}
FreeSysRequest( window );
return ( volume );
}

**INPUTS**

[Window](_00D4.md) = [Window](_00D4.md) pointer returned from [BuildSysRequest](BuildSysRequest.md) or
BuildEasyRequest().  Those functions can also return
values '0' or '1', and these values may also be
passed to SysReqHandler(), which will immediately
return the same value.

IDCMPFlagsPtr = If you passed application specific IDCMP
flags to [BuildSysRequest](BuildSysRequest.md) or BuildEasyRequest(),
SysReqHandler() will return -1 if that IDCMP message
is received.  If IDCMPFlagsPtr is non-null, it
points to a ULONG where the IDCMP class received
will be copied for your examination.

This pointer can be NULL if you have provided no
application specific IDCMP flags or if you do
not need to know which application specific IDCMP
event occurred.

If you provide more than on flag in the flags variable
this pointer points to, you will have to refresh
the variable whenever -1 is returned, since the
variable will have been changed to show just the
single IDCMP Class bit that caused the return.

WaitInput = Specifies that you want SysReqHandler() to
to wait for IDCMP input if there is none pending.

RESULT
0, 1, ..., N = Successive GadgetID values, for the gadgets
you specify for the requester.  NOTE: The numbering
from left to right is actually: 1, 2, ..., N, 0.
This is for compatibility with AutoRequests which has
FALSE for the rightmost gadget.

-1 = Means that one of the caller-supplied IDCMPFlags occurred.
The IDCMPFlag value is in the longword pointed to by UDCMP_ptr.

-2 = input processed did not satisfy the requester. One example
is a keystroke that does not satisfy the requester.  Another
example is if there is no input pending and you specified
FALSE for WaitInput.
