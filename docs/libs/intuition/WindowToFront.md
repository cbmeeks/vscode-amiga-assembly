**FUNCTION**

This routine sends a request to Intuition asking to bring the window
in front of all other windows in the screen.

Note that the window will not be depth-arranged immediately, but rather
will be arranged the next time Intuition receives an input event,
which happens currently at a minimum rate of ten times per second,
and a maximum of sixty times a second.

[Remember](_00D4.md) that WFLG_BACKDROP windows cannot be depth-arranged.

**INPUTS**

[Window](_00D4.md) = pointer to the structure of the window to be brought to front

RESULT
None
