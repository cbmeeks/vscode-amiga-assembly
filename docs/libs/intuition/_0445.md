**NAME**

GetColorMap -- allocate and initialize Colormap


**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    cm = GetColorMap( entries )
          d0                   d0

    struct ColorMap *GetColorMap( ULONG);

```

**FUNCTION**

Allocates, initializes and returns a pointer to a [ColorMap](_00B8.md)
data structure, later enabling calls to [SetRGB4](../graphics/SetRGB4.md)
and [LoadRGB4](../graphics/LoadRGB4.md) to load colors for a view port. The ColorTable
pointer in the [ColorMap](_00B8.md) structure points to a hardware
specific colormap data structure. You should not count on
it being anything you can understand. Use [GetRGB4](../graphics/GetRGB4.md) to
query it or [SetRGB4CM](../graphics/SetRGB4CM.md) to set it directly.

**INPUTS**

entries - number of entries for this colormap

RESULT
The pointer value returned by this routine, if nonzero,
may be stored into the ViewPort.ColorMap pointer.
If a value of 0 is returned, the system was unable
to allocate enough memory space for the required
data structures.
