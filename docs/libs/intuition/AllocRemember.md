**NAME**

AllocRemember -- [AllocMem](../exec/AllocMem.md) with tracking to make freeing easy.

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    MemBlock = AllocRemember( RememberKey, Size, Flags )
    D0                        A0           D0    D1

    APTR AllocRemember( struct Remember **, ULONG, ULONG );

```

**FUNCTION**

This routine calls the Exec [AllocMem](../exec/AllocMem.md) function for you, but also links
the parameters of the allocation into a master list, so that
you can simply call the Intuition routine [FreeRemember](FreeRemember.md) at a later
time to deallocate all allocated memory without being required to
remember the details of the memory you've allocated.

This routine will have two primary uses:
-   Let's say that you're doing a long series of allocations in a
procedure.  If any one of the allocations fails, your program
may need to abort the procedure.  Abandoning ship correctly
involves freeing up what memory you've already allocated.  This
procedure allows you to free up that memory easily, without being
required to keep track of how many allocations you've already done,
what the sizes of the allocations were, or where the memory was
allocated.

-   Also, in the more general case, you may do all of the allocations
in your entire program using this routine.  Then, when your
program is exiting, you can free it all up at once with a
simple call to [FreeRemember](FreeRemember.md).

You create the &#034;anchor&#034; for the allocation master list by creating
a variable that's a pointer to struct [Remember](_00D4.md), and initializing
that pointer to NULL.  This is called the RememberKey.  Whenever
you call AllocRemember(), the routine actually does two memory
allocations, one for the memory you want and the other for a copy
of a [Remember](_00D4.md) structure.  The [Remember](_00D4.md) structure is filled in
with data describing your memory allocation, and it's linked
into the master list pointed to by your RememberKey.  Then, to
free up any memory that's been allocated, all you have to do is
call [FreeRemember](FreeRemember.md) with your RememberKey.

Please read the [FreeRemember](FreeRemember.md) function description, too.  As you will
see, you can select either to free just the link nodes and keep all the
allocated memory for yourself, or to free both the nodes and your
memory buffers.


**INPUTS**

RememberKey = the address of a pointer to struct [Remember](_00D4.md).  Before the
very first call to AllocRemember, initialize this pointer to NULL.

Size = the size in bytes of the memory allocation.  Please refer to the
[exec.library/AllocMem](../exec/AllocMem.md) function for details.
Flags = the specifications for the memory allocation.  Please refer to
the [exec.library/AllocMem](../exec/AllocMem.md) function for details.

EXAMPLE
struct [Remember](_00D4.md) *RememberKey;
RememberKey = NULL;
buffer = AllocRemember(&#038;RememberKey, BUFSIZE, MEMF_CHIP);
if (buffer)
{
/* Use the buffer */
...
}
FreeRemember(&#038;RememberKey, TRUE);

RESULT
If the memory allocation is successful, this routine returns the byte
address of your requested memory block.  Also, the node to your block
will be linked into the list pointed to by your RememberKey variable.
If the allocation fails, this routine returns NULL and the list pointed
to by RememberKey, if any, will be unchanged.

BUGS
This function makes two allocations for each memory buffer
you request.  This is neither fast nor good for memory
fragmentation.

This function should use the exec AllocPool() function internally,
at least for the [Remember](_00D4.md) headers.
