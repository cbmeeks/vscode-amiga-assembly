**FUNCTION**

Gets a copy of the Intuition default preferences data.  Writes the
data into the buffer you specify.  The number of bytes you want
copied is specified by the size argument.

The default preferences are those that Intuition uses when it
is first opened.  If no preferences file is found, these are
the preferences that are used.  These would also be the startup
preferences in an AmigaDOS-less environment.

It is legal to take a partial copy of the [Preferences](_00D5.md) structure.
The more pertinent preferences variables have been grouped near
the top of the structure to facilitate the memory conservation
that can be had by taking a copy of only some of the [Preferences](_00D5.md)
structure.

**INPUTS**

PrefBuffer = pointer to the memory buffer to receive your copy of the
Intuition [Preferences](_00D5.md) structure
Size = the number of bytes in your PrefBuffer, the number of bytes
you want copied from the system's internal Preference settings

RESULT
Returns your parameter PrefBuffer.
