**NAME**

FreeMem -- deallocate with knowledge

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    FreeMem(memoryBlock, byteSize)
            A1           D0

    void FreeMem(void *,ULONG);

```
**FUNCTION**

Free a region of memory, returning it to the system pool from which
it came.  Freeing partial blocks back into the system pool is
unwise.

NOTE
If a block of memory is freed twice, the system will Guru. The
Alert is AN_FreeTwice ($01000009).   If you pass the wrong pointer,
you will probably see AN_MemCorrupt $01000005.  Future versions may
add more sanity checks to the memory lists.

**INPUTS**

memoryBlock - pointer to the memory block to free
byteSize - the size of the desired block in bytes.  (The operating
system will automatically round this number to a multiple of
the system memory chunk size)
