**NAME**

GetDefaultPubScreen -- Get name of default public screen. (V36)

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    GetDefaultPubScreen( Namebuff )
                         A0

    VOID GetDefaultPubScreen( UBYTE * );

```
**FUNCTION**

Provides the name of the current default public screen.
Only anticipated use is for Public [Screen](_00DD.md) Manager utilities,
since it is easy to open a visitor window on the default
public screen without specifying the name.

**INPUTS**

Namebuff = a buffer of MAXPUBSCREENNAME.  This can be NULL.

RESULT
None.  Will provide the string &#034;Workbench&#034; in Namebuff if there
is no current default public screen.

NOTE
This function actually &#034;returns&#034; in register D0 a pointer
to the public screen.  Unfortunately, the lifespan of
this pointer is not ensured; the screen could be closed
at any time.  The *ONLY* legitimate use we can see for
this return value is to compare for identity with the pointer
to a public screen you either have a window open in, or
a lock on using [LockPubScreen](LockPubScreen.md), to determine if that
screen is in fact the default screen.

BUGS
The function prototype does not reflect the return value.
