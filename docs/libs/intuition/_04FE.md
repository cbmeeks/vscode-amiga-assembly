**NAME**

TR_GETSYSTIME -- get the system time.

**FUNCTION**

Ask the system what time it is.  The system time starts off at
zero at power on, but may be initialized via the [TR_SETSYSTIME](_04FF.md)
call.

System time is monotonically increasing, and guaranteed to be
unique (except when the system time is set backwards).

io_Command      TR_GETSYSTIME
