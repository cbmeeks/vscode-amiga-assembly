**NAME**

WindowLimits -- Set the minimum and maximum limits of a window.

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    Success = WindowLimits( Window, MinWidth, MinHeight, MaxWidth,
    D0                      A0      D0        D1         D2
                            MaxHeight )
                            D3

    BOOL WindowLimits( struct Window *, WORD, WORD, UWORD, UWORD );

**FUNCTION**

Sets the minimum and maximum limits of the window's size.  Until this
routine is called, the window's size limits are equal to the initial
values established in the [OpenWindow](OpenWindow.md) function.

After a call to this routine, the [Window](_00D4.md) will be able to be sized
to any dimensions within the specified limits.

If you don't want to change any one of the dimensions, set the limit
argument for that dimension to zero.  If any of the limit arguments
is equal to zero, that argument is ignored and the initial setting
of that parameter remains undisturbed.

If any of the arguments is out of range (minimums greater than the
current size, maximums less than the current size), that limit
will be ignored, though the others will still take effect if they
are in range.  If any are out of range, the return value from this
procedure will be FALSE.  If all arguments are valid, the return
value will be TRUE.

If you want your window to be able to become &#034;as large as possible&#034;
you may put -1 (i.e. ~0) in either or both Max arguments.  But
please note: screen sizes may vary for several reasons, and you
must be able to handle any possible size of window you might end
up with if you use this method.  Note that you can use the function
[GetScreenData](GetScreenData.md) to find out how big the screen your window appears in
is.  That function is particularly useful if your window is in
the Workbench screen.  You may also refer to the WScreen field
in your window structure, providing that your window remains open,
which will ensure that the screen remains open, and thus the
pointer remains valid.

If the user is currently sizing this window, the new limits will
not take effect until after the sizing is completed.

**INPUTS**

[Window](_00D4.md) = pointer to a [Window](_00D4.md) structure
MinWidth, MinHeight, MaxWidth, MaxHeight = the new limits for the size
of this window.  If any of these is set to zero, it will
be ignored and that setting will be unchanged.

RESULT
Returns TRUE if everything was in order.  If any of the parameters was
out of range (minimums greater than current size, maximums less than
current size), FALSE is returned and the errant limit request is
not fulfilled (though the valid ones will be).
