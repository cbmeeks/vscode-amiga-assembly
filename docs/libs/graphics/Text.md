**NAME**

Text -- Write text characters (no formatting).

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    Text(rp, string, length)
         A1  A0      D0-0:16

    void Text(struct RastPort *, STRPTR, WORD);

```
Links: [RastPort](_00AF.md) 

**FUNCTION**

This graphics function writes printable text characters to the
specified [RastPort](_00AF.md) at the current position.  No control meaning
is applied to any of the characters, thus only text on the
current line is output.

The current position in the [RastPort](_00AF.md) is updated to the next
character position.
If the characters displayed run past the [RastPort](_00AF.md) boundary,
the current position is truncated to the boundary, and
thus does not equal the old position plus the text length.

**INPUTS**

rp     - a pointer to the [RastPort](_00AF.md) which describes where the
text is to be output
string - the address of string to output
length - the number of characters in the string.
If zero, there are no characters to be output.

NOTES
o   This function may use the blitter.
o   Changing the text direction with RastPort-&#062;TxSpacing is
not supported.

BUGS
For V34 and earlier:
o   The maximum string length (in pixels) is limited to
(1024 - 16 = 1008) pixels wide.
o   A text string whose last character(s) have a
tf_CharLoc size component that extends to the right of
the rightmost of the initial and final CP positions
will be (inappropriately) clipped.
