**NAME**

MakeScreen -- Do an Intuition-integrated [MakeVPort](MakeVPort.md) of a screen.

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    MakeScreen( Screen )
                A0

    VOID MakeScreen( struct Screen * );

```

**FUNCTION**

This procedure allows you to do a [MakeVPort](MakeVPort.md) for the viewport of your
custom screen in an Intuition-integrated way.  This way you can
do your own screen manipulations without worrying about interference
with Intuition's usage of the same viewport.

The operation of this function is as follows:
- Block until the Intuition [View](_00B8.md) structure is not in being changed.
- Set the view modes correctly to reflect if there is a (visible)
interlaced screen.
- call [MakeVPort](MakeVPort.md), passing the Intuition [View](_00B8.md) and your screen's
[ViewPort](_00B8.md).
- Unlocks the Intuition [View](_00B8.md).

After calling this routine, you should call [RethinkDisplay](../intuition/RethinkDisplay.md) to
incorporate the new viewport of your custom screen into the
Intuition display.

NOTE: Intuition may determine that because of a change in global
interlace needs that all viewports need to be remade, so
it may effectively call [RemakeDisplay](../intuition/RemakeDisplay.md).

**INPUTS**

[Screen](_00DD.md) = address of the custom screen structure

RESULT
None
