**NAME**

TextFit - count characters that will fit in a given extent (V36)

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    chars = TextFit(rastport, string, strLen, textExtent,
    D0              A1        A0      D0      A2
            constrainingExtent, strDirection,
            A3                  D1
            constrainingBitWidth, constrainingBitHeight)
            D2                    D3

    ULONG TextFit(struct RastPort *, STRPTR, UWORD,
        struct TextExtent *, struct TextExtent *, WORD, UWORD, UWORD);

**FUNCTION**

This function determines how many of the characters of the
provided string will fit into the space described by the
constraining parameters.  It also returns the extent of
that number of characters.

**INPUTS**

rp     - a pointer to the [RastPort](_00AF.md) which describes where the
text attributes reside.
string - the address of string to determine the constraint of
strLen - The number of characters in the string.
If zero, there are no characters in the string.
textExtent - a structure to hold the extent result.
constrainingExtent - the extent that the text must fit in.
This can be NULL, indicating only the constrainingBit
dimensions will describe the constraint.
strDirection - the offset to add to the string pointer to
get to the next character in the string.  Usually 1.
Set to -1 and the string to the end of the string to
perform a TextFit() anchored at the end.  No other value
is valid.
constrainingBitWidth - an alternative way to specify the
rendering box constraint width that is independent of
the rendering origin.  Range 0..32767.
constrainingBitHeight - an alternative way to specify the
rendering box constraint height that is independent of
the rendering origin.  Range 0..32767.

**RESULTS**

chars - the number of characters from the origin of the
given string that will fit in both the constraining
extent (which specifies a CP bound and a rendering
box relative to the origin) and in the rendering width
and height specified.

NOTES
The result is zero chars and an empty textExtent when the fit
cannot be performed.  This occurs not only when no text will
fit in the provided constraints, but also when:
-   the [RastPort](_00AF.md) rp's rp_TxSpacing sign and magnitude is so
great it reverses the path of the text.
-   the constrainingExtent does not include x = 0.
