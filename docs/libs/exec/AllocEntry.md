**NAME**

AllocEntry -- allocate many regions of memory

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    memList = AllocEntry(memList)
    D0                   A0

    struct MemList *AllocEntry(struct MemList *);

```

**FUNCTION**

This function takes a memList structure and allocates enough memory
to hold the required memory as well as a [MemList](_0089.md) structure to keep
track of it.

These [MemList](_0089.md) structures may be linked together in a task control
block to keep track of the total memory usage of this task. (See
the description of TC_MEMENTRY under RemTask).

**INPUTS**

memList -- A [MemList](_0089.md) structure filled in with [MemEntry](_0089.md) structures.

**RESULTS**

memList -- A different [MemList](_0089.md) filled in with the actual memory
allocated in the me_Addr field, and their sizes in me_Length.
If enough memory cannot be obtained, then the requirements of
the allocation that failed is returned and bit 31 is set.

WARNING: The result is unusual!  Bit 31 indicates faulure.

EXAMPLES
The user wants five regions of 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 bytes in size
with requirements of MEMF_CLEAR, MEMF_PUBLIC, MEMF_CHIP!MEMF_CLEAR,
MEMF_CLEAR, and MEMF_PUBLIC!MEMF_CLEAR respectively.  The
following code fragment would do that:

MemListDecl:
DS.B    LN_SIZE             * reserve space for list node
DC.W    5                   * number of entries
DC.L    MEMF_CLEAR                  * entry #0
DC.L    2
DC.L    MEMF_PUBLIC                 * entry #1
DC.L    4
DC.L    MEMF_CHIP!MEMF_CLEAR        * entry #2
DC.L    8
DC.L    MEMF_CLEAR                  * entry #3
DC.L    16
DC.L    MEMF_PUBLIC!MEMF_CLEAR      * entry #4
DC.L    32

start:
LEA.L   MemListDecl(PC),A0
JSR     _LVOAllocEntry(a6)
BCLR.L  #31,D0
BEQ.S   success

------- Type of memory that we failed on is in D0

BUGS
If any one of the allocations fails, this function fails to back
out fully.  This is fixed by the &#034;SetPatch&#034; program on V1.3
Workbench disks.
