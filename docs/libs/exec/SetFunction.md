**NAME**

SetFunction -- change a function vector in a library

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    oldFunc = SetFunction(library, funcOffset, funcEntry)
    D0                    A1       A0.W        D0

    APTR SetFunction(struct Library *,LONG,APTR);

```

**FUNCTION**

SetFunction is a functional way of changing where vectors in a
library point.  They are changed in such a way that the
checksumming process will never falsely declare a library to be
invalid.

**WARNING**

If you use SetFunction on a function that can be called from
interrupts, you are obligated to provide your own arbitration.

NOTE
SetFunction cannot be used on non-standard libraries like pre-V36
dos.library.  Here you must manually [Forbid](Forbid.md), preserve all 6
original bytes, set the new vector, [SumLibrary](SumLibrary.md), then [Permit](Permit.md).

**INPUTS**

library    - a pointer to the library to be changed
funcOffset - the offset of the function to be replaced
funcEntry  - pointer to new function

**RESULTS**

oldFunc    - pointer to the old function that was just replaced
