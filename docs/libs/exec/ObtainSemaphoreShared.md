**NAME**

ObtainSemaphoreShared -- gain shared access to a semaphore (V36)

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    ObtainSemaphoreShared(signalSemaphore)
                          a0

    void ObtainSemaphoreShared(struct SignalSemaphore *);

```

**FUNCTION**

A lock on a signal semaphore may either be exclusive, or shared.
Exclusive locks are granted by the [ObtainSemaphore](ObtainSemaphore.md) and
[AttemptSemaphore](AttemptSemaphore.md) functions.  Shared locks are granted by
ObtainSemaphoreShared().  Calls may be nested.

Any number of tasks may simultaneously hold a shared lock on a
semaphore.  Only one task may hold an exclusive lock.  A typical
application is a list that is often read, but only occasionally
written to.

Any exlusive locker will be held off until all shared lockers
release the semaphore.  Likewise, if an exlusive lock is held,
all potential shared lockers will block until the exclusive lock
is released.  All shared lockers are restarted at the same time.

EXAMPLE
ObtainSemaphoreShared(ss);
/* read data */
ReleaseSemaohore(ss);

ObtainSemaphore(ss);
/* modify data */
ReleaseSemaohore(ss);

NOTES
While this function was added for V36, the feature magically works
with all older semaphore structures.

A task owning a shared lock must not attempt to get an exclusive
lock on the same semaphore.

INPUT
signalSemaphore -- an initialized signal semaphore structure

NOTE
This call is guaranteed to preserve all registers, starting with
V37 exec.
