**NAME**

SetSignal -- define the state of this task's signals

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    oldSignals = SetSignal(newSignals, signalMask)
    D0                     D0          D1

    ULONG SetSignal(ULONG,ULONG);

```
**FUNCTION**

This function can query or modify the state of the current task's
received signal mask.  Setting the state of signals is considered
dangerous.  Reading the state of signals is safe.

**INPUTS**

newSignals - the new values for the signals specified in
signalSet.
signalMask - the set of signals to be affected.

**RESULTS**

oldSignals - the prior values for all signals

EXAMPLES
Get the current state of all signals:
SetSignal(0L,0L);
Clear the CTRL-C signal:
SetSignal(0L,SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C);


Check if the CTRL-C signal was pressed:

#include [&#060;libraries/dos.h&#062;](_0108.md)

/* Check &#038; clear CTRL_C signal */
if(SetSignal(0L,SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C) &#038; SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C)
{
printf(&#034;CTRL-C pressed!n&#034;);
}
