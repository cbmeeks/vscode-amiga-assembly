**NAME**

AvailMem -- memory available given certain requirements

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    size = AvailMem(attributes)
    D0              D1

    ULONG AvailMem(ULONG);

```
**FUNCTION**

This function returns the amount of free memory given certain
attributes.

To find out what the largest block of a particular type is, add
MEMF_LARGEST into the requirements argument.  Returning the largest
block is a slow operation.

**WARNING**

Due to the effect of multitasking, the value returned may not
actually be the amount of free memory available at that instant.

**INPUTS**

requirements - a requirements mask as specified in [AllocMem](AllocMem.md).  Any
of the [AllocMem](AllocMem.md) bits are valid, as is MEMF_LARGEST
which returns the size of the largest block matching
the requirements.

RESULT
size - total free space remaining (or the largest free block).

NOTE
For V36 Exec, AvailMem(MEMF_LARGEST) does a consistency check on
the memory list.  Alert AN_MemoryInsane will be pulled if any mismatch
is noted.

EXAMPLE
AvailMem(MEMF_CHIP|MEMF_LARGEST);
/* return size of largest available chip memory chunk */
