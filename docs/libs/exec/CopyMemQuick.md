**NAME**

CopyMemQuick - optimized memory copy function

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    CopyMemQuick( source, dest, size )
                  A0      A1    D0

    void CopyMemQuick(ULONG *,ULONG *,ULONG);

```
**FUNCTION**

CopyMemQuick is a highly optimized memory copy function, with
restrictions on the size and alignment of its arguments. Both the
source and destination pointers must be longword aligned.  In
addition, the size must be an integral number of longwords (e.g.
the size must be evenly divisible by four).

Arbitrary overlapping copies are not supported.

The internal implementation of this function will change from system
to system, and may be implemented via hardware DMA.

**INPUTS**

source - a pointer to the source data region, long aligned
dest -  a pointer to the destination data region, long aligned
size -  the size (in bytes) of the memory area.  Zero copies
zero bytes.
