**FUNCTION**

Insert or append a node into a system queue.  The insert is
performed based on the node priority -- it will keep the list
properly sorted.  New nodes will be inserted in front of the first
node with a lower priority.   Hence a FIFO queue for nodes of equal
priority

**WARNING**

This function does not arbitrate for access to the list.  The
calling task must be the owner of the involved list.

**INPUTS**

list - a pointer to the system queue header
node - the node to enqueue.  This must be a full featured list
with type, priority and name fields.
