**NAME**

**SYNOPSIS**

```c

**FUNCTION**

Traverse a system list until a node with the given name is found.
To find multiple occurrences of a string, this function may be
called with a node starting point.

No arbitration is done for access to the list!  If multiple tasks
access the same list, an arbitration mechanism such as
SignalSemaphores must be used.

**INPUTS**

start - a list header or a list node to start the search
(if node, this one is skipped)
name - a pointer to a name string terminated with NULL

**RESULTS**

node - a pointer to the node with the same name else
zero to indicate that the string was not found.
