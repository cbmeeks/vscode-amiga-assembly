**NAME**

CliInitNewcli -- Set up a process to be a shell from initial packet

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    flags = CliInitNewcli( packet )
    D0                       A0

    LONG CliInitNewcli( struct DosPacket * )

```

**FUNCTION**

This function initializes a process and CLI structure for a new
shell, from parameters in an initial packet passed by the system
(NewShell or NewCLI, etc).  The format of the data in the packet
is purposely not defined.  The setup includes all the normal fields
in the structures that are required for proper operation (current
directory, paths, input streams, etc).

It returns a set of flags containing information about what type
of shell invocation this is.

Definitions for the values of fn:
Bit 31     Set to indicate flags are valid
Bit  3     Set to indicate asynch system call
Bit  2     Set if this is a System() call
Bit  1     Set if user provided input stream
Bit  0     Set if RUN provided output stream

If Bit 31 is 0, then you must check [IoErr](IoErr.md) to determine if an error
occurred.  If [IoErr](IoErr.md) returns a pointer to your process, there has
been an error, and you should clean up and exit.  The packet will
have already been returned by CliInitNewcli().  If it isn't a pointer
to your process and Bit 31 is 0, reply the packet immediately.
(Note: this is different from what you do for CliInitRun().)

This function is very similar to [CliInitRun](CliInitRun.md).

**INPUTS**

packet - the initial packet sent to your process [MsgPort](_0099.md)

RESULT
fn - flags or a pointer
