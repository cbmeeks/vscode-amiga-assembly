**NAME**

Close -- Close an open file

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    success = Close( file )
       D0             D1

    BOOL Close(BPTR)

```
**FUNCTION**

The file specified by the file handle is closed. You must close all
files you explicitly opened, but you must not close inherited file
handles that are passed to you (each filehandle must be closed once
and ONLY once).  If Close() fails, the file handle is still
deallocated and should not be used.

**INPUTS**

file - BCPL pointer to a file handle

**RESULTS**

success - returns if Close() succeeded.  Note that it might fail
depending on buffering and whatever IO must be done to
close a file being written to.  NOTE: this return value
did not exist before V36!
