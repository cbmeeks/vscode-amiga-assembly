**FUNCTION**

This allows you to attempt to change the mode in use by a lock or

into an exclusive lock.  The handler may well reject this request.

crash.

**INPUTS**

object  - A lock or filehandle
newmode - The new mode you want

RESULT
success - Boolean

BUGS

earlier versions, it can crash the machine.
