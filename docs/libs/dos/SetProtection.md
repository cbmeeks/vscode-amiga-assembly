**NAME**

SetProtection -- Set protection for a file or directory

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    success = SetProtection( name, mask )
    D0                       D1    D2:4

    BOOL SetProtection (STRPTR, LONG)

```
**FUNCTION**

SetProtection() sets the protection attributes on a file or
directory. The lower bits of the mask are as follows:

bit 4: 1 = file has not changed         0 = file has been changed
bit 3: 1 = reads not allowed,           0 = reads allowed.
bit 2: 1 = writes not allowed,          0 = writes allowed.
bit 1: 1 = execution not allowed,       0 = execution allowed.
bit 0: 1 = deletion not allowed,        0 = deletion allowed.

Before V36, the ROM filesystem didn't respect the Read and Write
bits.  In V36 or later and in the FFS, the Read and Write
bits are respected.

The archive bit should be cleared by the filesystem whenever the file
is changed.  Backup utilities will generally set the bit after
backing up each file.

The V36 Shell looks at the execute bit, and will refuse to execute
a file if it is set.

Other bits will be defined in the [&#060;dos/dos.h&#062;](_0068.md) include files.  Rather
than referring to bits by number you should use the definitions in
[&#060;dos/dos.h&#062;](_0068.md).

**INPUTS**

name - pointer to a null-terminated string
