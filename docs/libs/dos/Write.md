**NAME**

Write -- Write bytes of data to a file

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    returnedLength =  Write( file, buffer, length )
    D0                       D1    D2      D3

    LONG Write (BPTR, void *, LONG)

```
**FUNCTION**

Write() writes bytes of data to the opened file 'file'. 'length'
indicates the length of data to be transferred; 'buffer' is a
pointer to the buffer. The value returned is the length of
information actually written. So, when 'length' is greater than
zero, the value of 'length' is the number of characters written.
Errors are indicated by a value of -1.

Note: this is an unbuffered routine (the request is passed directly
to the filesystem.)  Buffered I/O is more efficient for small
reads and writes; see [FPutC](FPutC.md).

**INPUTS**

file - BCPL pointer to a file handle
buffer - pointer to the buffer
length - integer

**RESULTS**

returnedLength - integer
