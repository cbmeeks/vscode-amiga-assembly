**NAME**

NameFromLock -- Returns the name of a locked object (V36)

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    success = NameFromLock(lock, buffer, len)
    D0                      D1     D2    D3

    BOOL NameFromLock(BPTR, STRPTR, LONG)

```
**FUNCTION**

Returns a fully qualified path for the lock.  This routine is
guaranteed not to write more than len characters into the buffer.  The
name will be null-terminated.  NOTE: if the volume is not mounted,
the system will request it (unless of course you set pr_WindowPtr to
-1).  If the volume is not mounted or inserted, it will return an
error.  If the lock passed in is NULL, &#034;SYS:&#034; will be returned. If
the buffer is too short, an error will be returned, and [IoErr](IoErr.md) will
return ERROR_LINE_TOO_LONG.

**INPUTS**

lock   - Lock of object to be examined.
buffer - Buffer to store name.
len    - Length of buffer.

RESULT
success - Success/failure indicator.

BUGS
Should return the name of the boot volume instead of SYS: for a NULL
lock.
