**NAME**

Exit -- Exit from a program

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    Exit( returnCode )
          D1

    void Exit(LONG)

```
**FUNCTION**

Exit() is currently for use with programs written as if they
were BCPL programs.  This function is not normally useful for
other purposes.

In general, therefore, please DO NOT CALL THIS FUNCTION!

In order to exit, C programs should use the C language exit()
function (note the lower case letter &#034;e&#034;).  Assembly programs should
place a return code in D0, and execute an RTS instruction with
their original stack ptr.

IMPLEMENTATION
The action of Exit() depends on whether the program which called it
is running as a command under a CLI or not. If the program is
running under the CLI the command finishes and control reverts to
the CLI. In this case, returnCode is interpreted as the return code
from the program.

If the program is running as a distinct process, Exit() deletes the
process and release the space associated with the stack, segment
list and process structure.

**INPUTS**

returnCode - integer
