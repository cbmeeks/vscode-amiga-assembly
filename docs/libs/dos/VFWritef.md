**NAME**

VFWritef - write a BCPL formatted string to a file (buffered) (V36)

**SYNOPSIS**

```c
    count = VFWritef(fh, fmt, argv)
    D0               D1  D2    D3

    LONG VFWritef(BPTR, STRPTR, LONG *)

    count = FWritef(fh, fmt, ...)

    LONG FWritef(BPTR, STRPTR, ...)

```
**FUNCTION**

Writes the formatted string and values to the default output.  This
routine is assumed to handle all internal buffering so that the
formatting string and resultant formatted values can be arbitrarily
long.  The formats are in BCPL form.  This routine is buffered.

Supported formats are:  (Note x is in base 36!)
%S  - string (CSTR)
%Tx - writes a left-justified string in a field at least
x bytes long.
%C  - writes a single character
%Ox - writes a number in octal, maximum x characters wide
%Xx - writes a number in hex, maximum x characters wide
%Ix - writes a number in decimal, maximum x characters wide
%N  - writes a number in decimal, any length
%Ux - writes an unsigned number, maximum x characters wide
%$  - ignore parameter

Note: 'x' above is actually the character value - '0'.

**INPUTS**

fmt   - BCPL style formatting string
argv  - Pointer to array of formatting values

RESULT
count - Number of bytes written or -1 for error

BUGS
As of V37, VFWritef() does NOT return a valid return value.  In
order to reduce possible errors, the prototypes supplied for the
system as of V37 have it typed as VOID.
