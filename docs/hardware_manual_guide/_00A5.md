SuperHires mode has a finer granularity of sprite positioning than either
Hires or Lores modes.  This allows for positioning the sprite every other
SuperHires pixel on 70ns boundaries.  The ECS registers SPRxPOS and
SPRxCTL work together as position, size and sprite feature control
registers.  They are usually loaded by the sprite DMA channel, during
horizontal blank, however they may be loaded by the processor.

The two registers are defined as follows:


SPRxPOS W   A D     Sprite x vertical-horiz start position data

Bit    |  Use    ||
----   |  ----  | ---|
15-08  |         ||
07-00  | SH8-SH1 | Start horizontal value. Low bit (SH0) in SPRxCTL.|


SPRxCTL W   A D     Sprite x position and control data

Bit    |  Use||
----   |  ----|--|
15-08|||
07|||
06|||
05|||
04 |     SHSH1   |  Start horizontal (SHR mode) 70ns increment|
03  |    SHSH0  |   Start horizontal (SHR mode) 35ns (unimplemented)|
02|||
01|||
00 |     SH0  |     Start horiz. value Low bit 140 ns increment|

Note: bits 3 and  4 are in the ECS chips only.

Warning
--------
70ns sprite positions are only available in SuperHires mode.
Attempting to use 70ns sprite positioning with Hires mode under
the current system may lead to unpredictable results.
